## Hi there 👋

I am estanislao sarandón, 

After a decade of working and leading sustainability projects ♻️, I decided to pursue my dream of becoming a software developer 🖥️. 
With hands-on experience as a backend developer, I’m currently diving deeper into the world of full-stack development through a C# .NET course 📚. 
I have always been curious about how things work; I like to open, inspect, test, and repair things 🪛.
Now, I am looking for a workplace where I can put all this passion and curiosity into action and take me to the next stage as a developer. 🚀
